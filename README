NestedModels
============

Until now ActiveRecord wasn't great with associations massive assignment (aka multi model forms handling).
This plugin allow to deal with this kind of problems.


Example
=======

class Project < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :tasks, :accessible => true
end

project = Project.create :name => "NestedModels", :tasks => [
  { :name => "Implement", :description => "Implement me" }
]

project.name # => "NestedModels"
project.taks.size # => 1
